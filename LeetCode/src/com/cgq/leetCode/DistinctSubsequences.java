 * Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of T in S.
	A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
	Here is an example:
	S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
	Return 3.
